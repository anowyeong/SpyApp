# SpyApp

The SpyApp is designed to encrypt messages with various encryption such as: Ceasar Cipher, AlphaNumericalCeasarCipher,
Mirror Cipher and AtBash Cipher.

The app has multiple input sections and input section and a secret section. The input box is where the messages being encrypted 
go. Clicking the encode button will activate the Cipher that was selected. The decode button will decrypt the message.
The secret box is the amount of displacement the letters (or numbers) the message will change to. Without the correct
secret and cipher, the message will not be decrypted correctly.

The Ceasar Cipher will change the letters in the message based on the secret's value. Only letters are allowed
Ex) if one was chosen, the message: hello -> ifmmp

The AlphaNumericalCeasar Cipher is the same as the Ceasar Cipher; however numbers are allowed. The output will
be in uppercased letters

The Mirror Cipher will reversed the input almost like a mirrored image. Changing the secret will also change the letter.
Letters and numbers are allowed. 

The Atbash Cipher will change the ordering of the letters. Only letters are allowed here. 
Ex) a <-> z, b <-> y , c <-> x
